I never thought I would have a favourite paper but here we are!\nIn the meantime, while my last working day of the year was on the 7th December, I have been working through Let’s Go by Alex Edwards. It is an excellent book on the Go programming language that reminds me of the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern from when I use to be a using C# and .NET Framework. I have also been working through Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron after it was recommended by a friend’s brother. It is very hands on focuses on getting a good grasp of the basics before jumping into any of the complex topics.\nIn terms of operating system and what I am going to use in 2024, I moved away from my beloved Ubuntu in December 2023 after 3 years and moved to MacOS to try and get a more portable development platform that I can use. So far so good, the M1 hasn’t let me down and brew, rectangle and raycast are pretty cool.
