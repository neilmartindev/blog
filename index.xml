      <description>What a year! I started off this year knowing very little about Openstack, Ansible and Terraform to presenting at the Computing Insight 2023 conference on the topic of Automated Deployment of Manufacturing Use-Cases through Openstack HPC. This demonstrated how we (The Manufacturing Technology Centre) managed to develop a platform that gave our engineers more autonomy via self-service infrastructure, allowing the Informatics and Modelling and Simulation teams to spend less time requesting their compute and more time doing their project work.</description>

      <description>Hello, I am Neil ðŸ¤“.
I am a Research Engineer at the Manufacturing Technology Centre and based within Merseyside in the UK. I sit within the Informatics department and specialise in cloud computing, high performance computing and distributed systems. I mostly use Openstack and Microsoft Azure in my day-to-day work but I am keen to get my teeth stuck into AWS at some point!
I enjoy using platforms and tools like Kubernetes, OpenTofu, Ansible to help businesses scale their infrastructure with good practice or make their overhead bureacracy chains shorter by implementing self service infrastructure.</description>
