After becoming interested with PyPSA-Earth through a conversation with Max and watching their progress. I have been looking to deploy PyPSA-Earth on my machine locally to run some very basic power system analysis models. However, my recent move to an M1 chip means that virtualisation for this is slightly different.

Traditionally, I would of used something similar to Virtualbox, HyperV or most recently QEMU on a host. However, due to the change I've had to do some exploring. 

OrbStack - Fast, light and simple deployment of machines and containers. One of the best I've seen that's just set up and go. It's beneficial that it's free for personal use and education but lacks a remote desktop utility.

Parrallels Desktop - An expensive option (Thanks Apple) that allows virtualisation. It is optimised for Apples Silicon chips and endorsed by Microsoft to run Windows.

UTM - Free virtualisation agent that allows you to virtualise or emulate to another chip such as Intel (not all packages are friendly with the Apple Silicon M1) so this will be what I will roll with to setup my development environment for PyPSA.

Notes: I have joined the PyPSA-Earth Discord and set to be at their next meeting, hopefully this can give me an introduction of their current pipeline of work and maybe where I can try and contribute.
