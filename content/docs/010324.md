For the next 4-6 weeks I am prepping for my AWS Solution Architect exam as a precursor for one of my next projects at work.

I am currently using Stephane Maarek's Udemy course for SAA-C03, John Bonso's practice exams and my own AWS tenant to do some live lab work. I have a trusty pencil and paper to note down any services, their benefits and a comparison to other services. Such as the different between EBS (Elastic Block Store) and EFS (Elastic File System).

So far, it seems incredibly similar to Openstack and Azure, so most of the work is learning the names and purpose of different services with AWS. The use of IAM roles seems to be a very good way of controlling user access for the platform. However, AWS as a whole seems to be more centered around Linux-friendly architecture.
