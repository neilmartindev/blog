While I have a few months until my prospective PhD starts, I've decided to spend the next few months learning the Flutter framework and develop a lightweight app locally that is for foodbanks in the UK. It will use the GiveFood API to pull through recent foodbank needs for locally registered foodbanks. 

There is an existing app out there that does something similar, however, it charges foodbanks to register on the app. My proposed app will be free and open-source. The app will be called Vavilo after the Soviet agronimist Nikolai Vavilov. 

Due to being a history nerd, I am fascinated with the work that was done at the Leningrad Seed Vault (Pavlosk Experimental Station) which housed around 325,000 seeds and was founded by Vavilov. Twelve scientists protecting the seed collection perished from hunger during the siege of Leningrad and chose not to eat the seeds. The seed vault was fundamental to restore plant biodiversity and to improve food security across Europe.
