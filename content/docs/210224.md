To improve my ability to be able to structure and plan energy modelling applications I have decided to make a start on some mathematics courses:

* College Algebra
* Linear Algebra
* Differential, Integral and Multivariable Calculus
* Statistics and Probability 

I believe this will give me a good foundation to be able to understand a number of different machine learning libraries as well as a greater understanding of what happens under the hood of various models. 

I've also found a number of useful energy tools:

* [PyPSA (Eur-Earth)](https://pypsa-meets-earth.github.io/)
* [OSeMOSYS](http://www.osemosys.org/get-started.html)
* [Renewables Nina](https://www.renewables.ninja/)
* [Kilowattsio](https://www.kilowatts.io/)

And some cool papers and articles:

* [Heat Recovery in Manufacturing](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/heat-recovery-opportunities-in-uk-manufacturing)
* [Georeferenced Industry Sites](https://zenodo.org/records/4687147#.YvOaxhxBy5c)
