To improve my ability to be able to structureenergy modelling with AI (notably machine learning) I have decided to make a start on some mathematics courses:

* College Algebra
* Linear Algebra
* Differential, Integral and Multivariable Calculus
* Statistics and Probability
* Intro to Statistical Learning 

I believe this will give me a good foundation to be able to understand a number of different machine learning libraries as well as a greater understanding of what happens under the hood of various models. What's the point using TensorFlow or PyTorch if you don't know vectors or tensors? 

I've also found a number of useful energy tools:

* [PyPSA (Eur/Earth)](https://pypsa-meets-earth.github.io/)
* [OSeMOSYS](http://www.osemosys.org/get-started.html)
* [Renewables Nina](https://www.renewables.ninja/)
* [Kilowattsio](https://www.kilowatts.io/)

And some cool papers and articles:

* [Industrial Waste Heat for Energy](https://www.dexma.com/blog-en/use-residual-heat-as-energy-source-in-industry/)
* [Heat Recovery in Manufacturing](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/heat-recovery-opportunities-in-uk-manufacturing)
* [Georeferenced Industry Sites](https://zenodo.org/records/4687147#.YvOaxhxBy5c)
* [AI Work by EON](https://www.eon.com/en/new-energy/digitization/artificial-intelligence.html)

Here are some books that I have been recommended to read after finished Geron's book:

* [Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/ml-pytorch-book.html)
* [Neural Networks from Scratch in Python](https://nnfs.io/)]
