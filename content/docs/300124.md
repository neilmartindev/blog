Within Openstack there is a feature called security groups. These allow admins to create rules for access into their machines by defining the port number of the access protocol such as 22 for SSH or 3389 for RDP.

From my own experience, I have witnessed a number of deployments having their own security groups for each project, which makes sense initially for the seperation of interests. However, when we look at some of the common protocols such as 1433 for MS SQL for example, these are universal across many projects and creating multiple security groups for the same port.

To avoid this, if there an administrator project/range with the critical services, this is where the security groups should live within the system. If the security groups are created here, once, then they can be passed to other projects via RBAC (role based access control). This removes the duplication across the system and defines the administrative range as the source of truth for all security groups.
