I am a Research Engineer at the Manufacturing Technology Centre and based in the UK. I specialise in cloud computing, high performance computing and distributed systems. I mostly use Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Openstack and use Terraform/OpenTofu to provision the infrastructure with code.

I am also a prospective PhD student at the University of Birmingham with a focus on using artificial intelligence for electrical power systems and will sit within the Power Systems Research Group.

To date, I have worked on a number of R&D projects in manufacturing to solve some of industries' biggest challenges and enjoy using modern compute services to help us solve those challenges.
