Hello, I am Neil ðŸ¤“.

I am a Research Engineer at the Manufacturing Technology Centre and based in Prescot,Merseyside in the UK. Within the Informatics department, I specialise in **cloud computing**, **high performance computing** and **distributed systems**. I mostly use **Openstack** and **Microsoft Azure** in my day-to-day work but I am keen to get my teeth stuck into **AWS** at some point beyond homelabs.

I am also a prospective PhD student at the University of Birmingham with a focus on using artificial intelligence for electrical power systems and will sit within the Power Systems Research Group. 

I have a few hobbies. I am a keen student of history, cartography and vexillology. I dabble with languages, my main focus being German and Welsh. Outside of that sphere, I enjoy running and fixed-gear bicycles.
