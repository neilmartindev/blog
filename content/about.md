Hello, I am Neil ðŸ¤“.

I am a Research Engineer at the Manufacturing Technology Centre and based within Merseyside in the UK. I sit within the Informatics department and specialise in **cloud computing**, **high performance computing** and **distributed systems**. I mostly use **Openstack** and **Microsoft Azure** in my day-to-day work but I am keen to get my teeth stuck into **AWS** at some point!

I enjoy using platforms and tools like **Kubernetes**, **OpenTofu**, **Ansible** to help businesses scale their infrastructure with good practice or make their overhead bureacracy chains shorter by implementing self service infrastructure. I also enjoy teaching these platforms to graduates or people who have just transitioned into a technology career so I always take an open book approach to questions. I am a big believer in making things as simple as possible and avoiding overcomplication and good documentation aids that.

Recently, my work has been focused on implementing **digital threads** for manufacturing processes such as **circular manufacturing**, **electric vehicle battery disassembly** and **smart factories**. Within the department I am labelled as a "Windows Domain Expert" (not sure if I am to be proud of that? anyway) and I advise on good practice for our research based Windows environments and help with any remedy action that is needed from penetration tests. I am a Unix nerd also and run Ubuntu as my distrobution on any machines that I use for development work. I do not use Vim as my primary development environment though, I use VS Code so I might of lost some golden stickers for any techies reading this.

Outside of work, I have a few hobbies. I am a keen student of history, cartography and vexillology. I dabble with languages, my main focus being German and Welsh. Outside of that sphere, I enjoy running and take part in local 10k and 15k trail runs with the hopes of doing my first marathon.
