I am a Research Engineer at the Manufacturing Technology Centre and based in the UK. I specialise in cloud computing, high performance computing and distributed systems. I mostly use Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Openstack and use Terraform/OpenTofu to provision the infrastructure with code.

To date, I have worked on a number of R&D projects in manufacturing to solve some of industries' biggest challenges. I really enjoy building and deploying fault-tolerant systems on the cloud.
